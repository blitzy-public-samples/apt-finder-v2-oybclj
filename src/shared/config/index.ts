// src/shared/config/index.ts

// Import all exports from the environment file
import * as environment from './environment';

// Re-export all imports from the environment file
export * from './environment';

// Export the environment object as default
export default environment;

// Human tasks:
// TODO: Implement and export specific configuration variables and functions in the environment.ts file
// TODO: Review and adjust exported configuration based on the actual requirements of the Apartment Finder application

```

This implementation follows the JSON specification provided for the src/shared/config/index.ts file. It imports all exports from the environment.ts file and re-exports them. It also exports the entire environment object as the default export.

The human tasks are included as TODO comments at the end of the file, as requested in the specification. These tasks remind developers to implement the actual configuration in the environment.ts file and to review the exports based on the application's requirements.

This structure allows for easy import of all configuration items in other parts of the application using a single import statement, as mentioned in the specification. For example:

```typescript
import * as config from '@shared/config';
```

or

```typescript
import config from '@shared/config';
