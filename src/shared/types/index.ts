// This file serves as the main entry point for exporting shared types used across the Apartment Finder application.
// It aggregates and re-exports types from various type definition files within the shared types directory.

// TODO: Uncomment and update the following line once common.types.ts is created
// export * from './common.types';

// TODO: Add more type exports as they are created in this directory

// Human Tasks:
// 1. Create and implement the common.types.ts file with shared type definitions
// 2. Review and ensure all necessary shared types are exported from this index file
