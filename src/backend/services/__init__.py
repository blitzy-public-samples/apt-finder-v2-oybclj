# src/backend/services/__init__.py

# Import ZillowService from the zillow module
from .zillow import ZillowService

# Import PayPalService from the paypal module
from .paypal import PayPalService

# Human tasks:
# TODO: Implement the ZillowService in zillow.py
# TODO: Implement the PayPalService in paypal.py

# Export the services
__all__ = ['ZillowService', 'PayPalService']
```

This implementation does the following:

1. It imports the `ZillowService` and `PayPalService` from their respective modules.
2. It includes comments for the pending human tasks to implement these services.
3. It exports both services using the `__all__` list, making them easily importable from the `services` package.

This structure allows other parts of the application to import these services like this:

```python
from services import ZillowService, PayPalService
